# Offsets
The colour cameras need their offsets manually determining. This is where I keep a record of these values,

Compute by finding point in colour image, and subtracting location in greyscale image.

| Camera | Box | Offset |
|--------|-----|--------|
|C-DA3075132|1033|-16, -52|
|C-DA3075143|1034|25,51|
|C-DA3063854|1035|-4,81|

(offset gives how far point in colour image is from the greyscale).

JSON code:
```{"C-DA3075132":[-16, -52],"C-DA3075143":[25,51],"C-DA3063854":[-4,81]}```
